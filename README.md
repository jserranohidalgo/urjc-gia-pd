This is the repository of the course on Declarative Programming taught at the Artificial 
Intelligence Degree of the University Rey Juan Carlos. 


# Content 

The course material basically includes several notebooks on the following topics:

* Topic 1. [Introduction & schedule](Intro.pdf) (spanish, URJC specifics)
* Topic 2. Strongly-typed languages
* Topic 3. Algebraic data types
* Topic 4. The Curry-Howard correspondence
* Topic 5. Recursive functions and data types
* Topic 6. Higher-order functions and modular programming
* Topic 7. Applications

# Launching notebooks

To access these notebooks you need first to install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and clone this repository in your local drive: 

`> git clone https://github.com/jserranohidalgo/urjc-gia-pd.git pd`

Then, install `jupyter` (see instructions below) and run the program:

`jupyter notebook` 

in the root directory of the repository.

Alternatively, you can skip the manual installation of `jupyter`
and run it through [docker](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) as follows:

`docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -m 4g -v "$PWD":/home/jovyan/work almondsh/almond:latest` (LINUX)

`docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -m 4g -v <<c:/path/to/downloaded/folder>>:/home/jovyan/work almondsh/almond:latest` (WINDOWS)

(also in the root directory of the repository)

Finally, note that `jupyter` is already installed in the virtual environment MyApps (just for URJC users).

# Installing jupyter and the Scala kernel

To install jupyter and run Scala notebooks, follow these steps:

* Install the package manager [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), or use `pip`, the python package manager.
* Install [`jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/install) itself
* Alternatively, you can also find jupyter notebooks for free when installing [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual-d).
* Install [Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html#A1096936). Take into account whether your architecture is 32-bit or 64-bit.
* Install the Scala plugin [`almond`](https://almond.sh/docs/quick-start-install)

### Possible problems when installing almond

* On windows, I can't download the installation scripts of the `almond` Scala kernel through:

	> bitsadmin /transfer downloadCoursierCli https://git.io/coursier-cli "Í%%coursier"
	> ...

Likely, you are using powershell; use simple `cmd` instead. 

Possibly, you will also need to use administration privileges (i.e., run CMD as admin).


* In the thir step (".\coursier launch --fork ..."), the following error pops up:

Exception in thream "main" java.lang.Exception: Unrecognized CPU architecture: x86. 

Likely, you need a java version for 64 bits, but you installed one for 32 bits. Check which java version you have by typing: "java -d64 -version".

* Now, the installation command hangs (most likely, on windows)

Execute the installation command with the verbose option enabled (`-v -v`):

        .\coursier launch --fork almond -M almond.ScalaKernel -v -v -- --install

When the program hangs, stop it (C-c C-c). Most likely, the last command that was attempted was something like "Running java ...". Copy-paste that java invocation and run it manually:

        java -Dscala-kernel.version=<...> -jar <...> --install

Luckily, this will complete the installation of the almond kernel.

* "Cannot find default main class. Specify one with -M or --main-class" (most likely, on linux)

Add the option `-M almond.ScalaKernel`  to the installation command, i.e.

        ./coursier launch --fork almond -M almond.ScalaKernel -- --install
