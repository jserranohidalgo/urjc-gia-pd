    "Every programming language offers _primitive_ types, such as the types of boolean values, integer and double numeric values, strings, etc. But they also provide mechanisms to define new types, so-called user-defined types, which are designed to satisfy the needs of particular applications. For instance, user-defined types in object-oriented languages are specified through class or trait declarations; and types can also be specified from already existing user-defined types through the inheritance mechanism.

    "In functional programming, the rules for declaring new types are different: no inheritance or classes, just _products_, _sums_ and _exponentiation_ of types. Because of the correspondence with arithmetic (which goes beyond the terminology!), these types are called **algebraic data types** (ADTs). "

This is a classic paper that motivates the need for functional programming by appealing to software enginerring principles such as modularity. It's written using the Miranda programming language, and it's more an academic paper that undergraduate material. Nevertheless, its reading is highly recommeded.
